The following series of images are the solutions generated by the Elastic Neighbourhood for each of the tours in the Art TSP dataset \cite{ArtTSP}. These pieces are a wonderful intersection between art and science and demonstrate that creativity can flourish in the bounds analytical methodology. They are generated by the excellent method of Bosch and Kaplan (2005) \cite{bridges2005301}. I highly encourage looking at each of their work: at \href{https://www2.oberlin.edu/math/faculty/bosch/tspart-page.html}{https://www2.oberlin.edu/math/faculty/bosch/tspart-page.html} and \href{https://isohedral.ca/}{https://isohedral.ca/}. My personal favourite in the following collection is \textit{The Desperate Man} by Courbet.
