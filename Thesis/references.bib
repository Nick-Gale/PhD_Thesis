	abstract  = "Models of unsupervised, correlation-based (Hebbian) synaptic
	plasticity are typically unstable: either all synapses grow
	until each reaches the maximum allowed strength, or all synapses
	decay to zero strength. A common method of avoiding these
	outcomes is to use a constraint that conserves or limits the
	total synaptic strength over a cell. We study the dynamic
	effects of such constraints. Two methods of enforcing a
	constraint are distinguished, multiplicative and subtractive.
	For otherwise linear learning rules, multiplicative enforcement
	of a constraint results in dynamics that converge to the
	principal eigenvector of the operator determining unconstrained
	synaptic development. Subtractive enforcement, in contrast,
	typically leads to a final state in which almost all synaptic
	strengths reach either the maximum or minimum allowed value.
	This final state is often dominated by weight configurations
	other than the principal eigenvector of the unconstrained
	operator. Multiplicative enforcement yields a ?graded? receptive
	field in which most mutually correlated inputs are represented,
	whereas subtractive enforcement yields a receptive field that is
	?sharpened? to a subset of maximally correlated inputs. If two
	equivalent input populations (e.g., two eyes) innervate a common
	target, multiplicative enforcement prevents their segregation
	(ocular dominance segregation) when the two populations are
	weakly correlated; whereas subtractive enforcement allows
	segregation under these circumstances. These results may be used
	to understand constraints both over output cells and over input
	cells. A variety of rules that can implement constrained
	dynamics are discussed.",

	unified classification of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs),

	METHODS: AL was measured at postnatal day (P) 58 in C57BL/6J
	mice. Repeated AL measurements were taken using a custom-made 780
	nm PCI and a commercial 1310 nm SD-OCT. Intra- and interuser

	2-degree off-axes angles with the SD-OCT. Data were collected and
	analyzed using Cronbach alpha ($\alpha$), Bland-Altman
	coefficient of repeatability, agreement plots, and intraclass
	correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: AL measurements agreed
	well between the two instruments (3.262 $\pm$ 0.042 mm for PCI;
	3.264 $\pm$ 0.047 mm for SD-OCT; n = 20 eyes). The ICC for PCI
	compared with SD-OCT was 0.92, confirming high agreement between
	the two instruments. Intrauser ICC for the PCI and SD-OCT were
	0.814 and 0.995, respectively. Similarly, interuser ICC for PCI
	and SD-OCT were 0.970 and 0.943, respectively. Using SD-OCT, a
	2-degree misalignment of the eye along the horizontal meridian
	produced mean differences in AL of -0.002 $\pm$ 0.017 mm relative
	to the centrally aligned images, whereas similar misalignment

	abstract = "The retinotectal projection is the predominant model for studying
	molecular mechanisms controlling development of topographic
	axonal connections. Our analyses of topographic mapping of
	retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in chick optic tectum indicate
	that a primary role for guidance molecules is to regulate
	topographic branching along RGC axons, a process that imposes
	unique requirements on the molecular control of map development.
	We show that topographically appropriate connections are
	established exclusively by branches that form along the axon
	shaft. Initially, RGC axons overshoot their appropriate
	termination zone (TZ) along the anterior-posterior (A-P) tectal
	axis; temporal axons overshoot the greatest distance and nasal

	A-P gradient of ephrin-A repellents. In contrast, branches form
	along the shaft of RGC axons with substantial A-P topographic
	specificity. Topography is enhanced through the preferential
	arborization of appropriately positioned branches and elimination
	of ectopic branches. Using a membrane stripe assay and time-lapse
	microscopy, we show that branches form de novo along retinal
	axons. Temporal axons preferentially branch on their
	topographically appropriate anterior tectal membranes. After the
	addition of soluble EphA3-Fc, which blocks ephrin-A function,
	temporal axons branch equally on anterior and posterior tectal

	establish topographically precise projection to the superior
	colliculus of the midbrain. This means that axons of
	neighboring retinal ganglion cells project to the proximal
	locations in the target. The precision of topographic
	projection is a result of combined effects of molecular
	labels, such as Eph receptors and ephrins, and correlated
	neural activity. In the Isl2/EphA3 mutant mice the expression
	levels of molecular labels are changed. As a result the
	topographic projection is rewired so that the neighborhood
	relationships between retinal cell axons are disrupted.
	RESULTS: Here we study the computational model for
	retinocollicular connectivity formation that combines the
	effects of molecular labels and correlated neural activity. We
	argue that the effects of correlated activity presenting
	themselves in the form of Hebbian learning rules can
	facilitate the restoration of the topographic connectivity
	even when the molecular labels carry conflicting instructions.
	This occurs because the correlations in electric activity
	carry information about retinal cells' origin that is
	independent on molecular labels. We argue therefore that
	partial restoration of the topographic property of the
	retinocollicular projection observed in Isl2/EphA3
	heterozygous knockin mice may be explained by the effects of
	correlated neural activity. We address the maps observed in
	Isl2/EphA3 knockin/EphA4 knockout mice in which the levels of
	retinal labels are uniformly reduced. These maps can be
	explained by either the saturation of EphA receptor mapping
	leading to the relative signaling model or by the reverse
	signaling conveyed by ephrin-As expressed by retinal axons.
	CONCLUSION: According to our model, experiments in Isl2/EphA3

	retinocollicular maps in knock-in mice [Brown et al. (2000) Cell
	102:77]. In wild-type mice the temporal-nasal axis of retina is
	mapped to the rostral-caudal axis of superior colliculus. The
	established map is single-valued, which implies that each point
	in retina maps to a unique termination zone in superior
	colliculus. In homozygous Isl2/EphA3 knock-in mice the map is
	double-valued, which means that each point on retina maps to two
	termination zones in superior colliculus. This is because about
	50 percent of cells in retina express Isl2, and two types of
	projections, wild-type and Isl2/EphA3 positive, form two branches
	of the map. In heterozygous Isl2/EphA3 knock-ins the map is
	intermediate between the homozygous and wild-type: it is
	single-valued in temporal and double-valued in the nasal parts of
	retina. In this study we address possible reasons for such a
	bifurcation of the map. RESULTS: We study the map formation using
	stochastic model based on Markov chains. In our model the map
	undergoes a series of reconstructions with probabilities
	dependent upon a set of chemical cues. Our model suggests that
	the map in heterozygotes is single-valued in temporal region of
	retina for two reasons. First, the inhomogeneous gradient of
	endogenous receptor in retina makes the impact of exogenous
	receptor less significant in temporal retina. Second, the
	gradient of ephrin in the corresponding region of superior
	colliculus is smaller, which reduces the chemical signal-to-noise
	ratio. We predict that if gradient of ephrin is reduced by a
	genetic manipulation, the single-valued region of the map should
	extend to a larger portion of temporal retina, i.e. the point of
	transition between single-and double-valued maps should move to a
	more nasal position in Isl2-EphA3 heterozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: We
	present a theoretical model for retinocollicular map development,
	which can account for intriguing behaviors observed in
	gain-of-function experiments by Brown et al., including
	bifurcation in heterozygous Isl2/EphA3 knock-ins. The model is

	intracortical connections, or a combination of both. Here we
	present an investigation that concentrates on and, only for the
	sake of simplicity, restricts itself to intracortical circuits,
	in particular, with respect to the developmental aspects of
	direction selectivity through spike-timing-dependent synaptic
	plasticity. We show that directional responses can emerge in a
	recurrent network model of visual cortex with spiking neurons
	that integrate inputs mainly from a particular direction, thus
	giving rise to an asymmetrically shaped receptive field. A
	moving stimulus that enters the receptive field from this
	(preferred) direction will activate a neuron most strongly
	because of the increased number and/or strength of inputs from
	this direction and since delayed isotropic inhibition will
	neither overlap with, nor cancel excitation, as would be the
	case for other stimulus directions. It is demonstrated how
	direction-selective responses result from spatial asymmetries in
	the distribution of synaptic contacts or weights of inputs
	delivered to a neuron by slowly conducting intracortical axonal
	delay lines. By means of spike-timing-dependent synaptic
	plasticity with an asymmetric learning window this kind of
	coupling asymmetry develops naturally in a recurrent network of
	stochastically spiking neurons in a scenario where the neurons
	are activated by unidirectionally moving bar stimuli and even

	low to high LM gradient in the tectum. RGC axons lack DV ordering
	along the LM tectal axis, but directionally extend interstitial

	extension and arborization of interstitial branches extended by
	RGC axons arising from the same DV position: branches that arise
	from axons positioned lateral to the correct TZ are attracted up
	the gradient of ephrin-B1 and branches that arise from axons
	positioned medial to the same TZ are repelled down the ephrin-B1
	gradient. Alternatively, EphB receptor signaling may act as a
	'ligand-density sensor' and titrate signaling pathways that

	The cortex can preferentially allocate area to represent the

	learning tasks dependent on the use of the behaviorally important
	peripheral inputs that they represent. The rules governing this

	inputs, including learning, are increasingly well understood. In
	parallel with developments in the field of cortical map
	plasticity, studies of synaptic plasticity have characterized
	specific elementary forms of plasticity, including associative
	long-term potentiation and long-term depression of excitatory

	strides toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of these
	fundamental plasticity processes and toward defining the learning
	rules that govern their induction. The fields of cortical

	counter-gradients of labels across the target and confirming
	that the model reproduces the retinocollicular maps found in

	distributions of label within the retina lead to abnormal
	distributions of label over the target, so that in each of the
	types of knockin/knockout mice analysed, there will be a
	different distribution of labels over the target structure.

	Their ligands, ephrin-As, are expressed in a gradient along
	the rostrocaudal axis of the SC. Countergradients of ephrin-As
	in the retina and EphAs in the SC are also expressed.
	Disruption of any of these gradients leads to mapping errors.
	Gierer's (1981) model, which uses well-matched pairs of
	gradients and countergradients to establish the mapping, can
	account for the formation of wild type maps, but not the
	double maps found in EphA knock-in experiments. I show that
	these maps can be explained by models, such as Gierer's
	(1983), which have gradients and no countergradients, together
	with a powerful compensatory mechanism that helps to
	distribute connections evenly over the target region. However,
	this type of model cannot explain mapping errors found when
	the countergradients are knocked out partially. I examine the
	relative importance of countergradients as against
	compensatory mechanisms by generalising Gierer's (1983) model
	so that the strength of compensation is adjustable. Either
	matching gradients and countergradients alone or poorly
	matching gradients and countergradients together with a strong
	compensatory mechanism are sufficient to establish an ordered
	mapping. With a weaker compensatory mechanism, gradients
	without countergradients lead to a poorer map, but the
	addition of countergradients improves the mapping. This model
	produces the double maps in simulated EphA knock-in
	experiments and a map consistent with the Math5 knock-out
	phenotype. Simulations of a set of phenotypes from the
	literature substantiate the finding that countergradients and
	compensation can be traded off against each other to give
	similar maps. I conclude that a successful model of retinotopy

	retino-tectal projection) is proposed. Components of axonal
	growth cones and target tissue interact and cooperate, within the
	area of contact, to generate a guiding parameter, in the simplest
	case a ``guiding substance'' of distribution p. The components
	which are involved in this production are assumed to have graded
	distributions with respect to position in the projecting and
	target area, respectively. The distribution p thus produced
	guides the growth cone in the direction of maximal slope until
	the minimal value of p is reached. In this way, each growth cone
	can be guided to a position on the target tissue which depends on
	the origin of the fiber in such a manner that a projection
	results. Adhesive forces could but need not be involved in the
	guiding mechanism. The slope of p may interfere with an
	intracellular pattern forming mechanism within the growth cone,
	determining the polarity of activation (as modelled previously on
	the basis of autocatalysis and lateral inhibition) and thus the
	direction of growth. For the generation of a distribution of p

	the projecting and target area suffice, involving one or two
	components in each dimension. Their effect on the generation of p
	may be activatory as well as inhibitory. Exponential gradients
	give rise to particularly simple mapping functions. The following
	is an example of this general type of model: Growth cones as well
	as target tissue contribute to the production of a guiding
	substance. For each dimension, there is, in the target tissue, an
	exponentially graded component exerting (directly or indirectly)
	two functions: it actively produces guiding substance p and it

	abstract  = "We describe a model for cortical development that resolves
	long-standing difficulties of earlier models. It is proposed
	that, during embryonic development, synchronous firing of
	neurons and their competition for limited metabolic resources
	leads to selection of an array of neurons with ultra-small-world
	characteristics. Consequently, in the visual cortex,
	macrocolumns linked by superficial patchy connections emerge in
	anatomically realistic patterns, with an ante-natal arrangement
	which projects signals from the surrounding cortex onto each
	macrocolumn in a form analogous to the projection of a Euclidean
	plane onto a M{\"o}bius strip. This configuration reproduces
	typical cortical response maps, and simulations of signal flow
	explain cortical responses to moving lines as functions of
	stimulus velocity, length, and orientation. With the
	introduction of direct visual inputs, under the operation of
	Hebbian learning, development of mature selective response
	``tuning'' to stimuli of given orientation, spatial frequency,
	and temporal frequency would then take place, overwriting the
	earlier ante-natal configuration. The model is provisionally
	extended to hierarchical interactions of the visual cortex with
	higher centers, and a general principle for cortical processing
	of spatio-temporal images is sketched.",
